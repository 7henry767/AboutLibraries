{"name":"AboutLibraries","tagline":"AboutLibraries is a library to offer some information of libraries.","body":"AboutLibraries\r\n==============\r\n\r\nAboutLibraries is a library to offer you all the information you need of your libraries!\r\n\r\nMost modern apps feature an \"Used Library\"-Section and for this some information of those libs is required. As it gets annoying to copy those strings always to your app I've developed this small helper library to provide the required information.\r\n\r\nAll libraries are provided as *_strings.xml file in this library project. The project will auto-initialize those wihtout any extra effort.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that devs include a *_strings.xml in their project (if they follow the specific definition) and you can use those information too!\r\n\r\nIf you would love to add a new library just create a {libraryName}_strings.xml file and add the specific information.\r\nYou can do a pull-request for this project, or better do the pull request for the library project.\r\n\r\nAfter that you can sipmly use the new information in all your projects!\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluding in your project\r\n============\r\n###Using Maven\r\nAnimatedGridView Library is pushed to [Maven Central], so you just need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndependencies {\r\n\tcompile 'com.tundem.aboutlibraries:library:1.1.0@aar'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThe prefered method to get a Libs instance is by passing the string-field-array\r\n```java\r\nLibs libs = Libs.getInstance(getActivity(), R.string.class.getFields());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can use the instance to get the information\r\n```java\r\nlibs.getLibrary(\"ActionBarSherlock\")\r\n```\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluding in your library\r\n============\r\n\r\nCreate a {yourlib}_strings.xml in your values folder and define the required information.\r\n\r\nSample *_strings.xml (ActionBarSherlock)\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<resources>\r\n\r\n    <string name=\"define_ActionBarSherlock\"></string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_author\">Jake Wharton</string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_authorWebsite\">http://jakewharton.com/</string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_libraryName\">ActionBarSherlock</string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_libraryDescription\">ActionBarSherlock is an standalone library designed to facilitate the use of the action bar design pattern across all versions of Android through a single API.</string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_libraryVersion\">4.3.1</string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_libraryWebsite\">http://actionbarsherlock.com/</string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_licenseVersion\">Apache Version 2.0</string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_licenseContent\">Copyright 2012 Jake Wharton\r\n\r\n\t\tLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n\t\tyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n\t\tYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n\t\tdistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n\t\tWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n\t\tSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n\t\tlimitations under the License.</string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_isOpenSource\">true</string>\r\n    <string name=\"libray_ActionBarSherlock_repositoryLink\">https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock</string>\r\n\r\n</resources>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped By\r\n============\r\n\r\n* Mike Penz - http://mikepenz.com - <penz@tundem.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2014 Mike Penz\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

    <string name="libray_AboutLibraries_libraryDescription">AboutLibraries is a library to offer some information of libraries.
        \n\n
        Most modern apps feature an Used Library-Section and for this some information of those libs is required. As it gets annoying to copy those strings
        always to your app I have developed this small helper library to provide the required information.
